This is the southern of the two connected buildings, the other (which abuts Water St) is the courthouse.

Students will divide into groups of three. Using public documents and databases, you will search for the information listed below. Note: there is a large information board just inside the fron door, which should help you locate the offices you need to visit. In some of these offices, you will find (aging) computer terminals that you can use to search for the information you need. In others, you will need to ask the staff. At all points, don't hestitate to ask staff if you need help!

In some cases, information may not be available. If so, give your best explanation of why you couldn't find it, and whether it might be available for another source. That counts as a completed answer; a blank space on the form does not.

Be careful with name variants. Does the official have a longer full name than the one they commonly use? Have you confused them with another citizen with the same name?

We will meet on the front steps again at 9.30am, when you can hand me your completed forms.



#### Each group should choose one of these public officials to investigate:

Santa Cruz City Mayor [**Cynthia Chase**](http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/city-government/city-council/councilmembers/cynthia-chase)

Santa Cruz County Supervisor [**Zach Friend**](http://www.co.santa-cruz.ca.us/Government/BoardofSupervisors/District2.aspx)

Santa Cruz County Supervisor [**John Leopold**](http://www.co.santa-cruz.ca.us/Government/BoardofSupervisors/District1.aspx)

Santa Cruz City Vice Mayor [**David Terrazas**](http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/city-government/city-council/councilmembers/david-terrazas)

If you finish before time, start on a second official!
