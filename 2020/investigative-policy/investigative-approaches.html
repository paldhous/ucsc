<h3 id="thoughts-arising-from-discussion"><a name="thoughts-arising-from-discussion" href="#thoughts-arising-from-discussion"></a>Thoughts arising from discussion</h3><h5 id="think-about-the-human-sources-who-can-help-you"><a name="think-about-the-human-sources-who-can-help-you" href="#think-about-the-human-sources-who-can-help-you"></a>Think about the human sources who can help you</h5><p>In some of the articles we discussed, the reporters may have been tipped off to the initial story by an interested party — who may also have provided documents or data. Whistleblowers are very important for investigative journalists.</p><p>The story about Garda, in particular, depended heavily on information provided by former employees: not only drivers, but also Christine Bouquin, the company’s former director of risk management. Someone also provided the internal Garda database that drove a lot of the reporting for this story.</p><p>It also seems likely that the story about the Children’s Heart Institute was triggered initially by a whistleblower coming to the Tampa Bay Times after failing to make progress through official channels.</p><p>Similarly, BuzzFeed News’s WWF investigation involved a lot of reporting, but at the core of it were internal documents and emails, almost certainly provided by a current or former insider, which revealed the organization’s complicity in human rights abuses.</p><p>At this stage in your career, you probably won’t have whistleblowers eager to hand you a story to pursue. But there are still plenty of people who will be motivated to help you. Academics and non-governmental organizations with an interest in the issue can be very useful, as can attorneys representing a party in a lawsuit. Of course, you need to be aware that most interested parties have an agenda, which you must bear in mind. But the information they can provide may still be very useful.</p><p>It’s very important to remember that your sources are people, who should be treated with care and respect. That’s particularly important when dealing with ordinary people who have had bad experiences that you’re highlighting. This will have been a key consideration in the reporting for some these stories, especially the piece about botched pediatric heart surgey.</p><p>Most people don’t necessarily understand how journalism works. So take time to explain the process, for example so that they realize that seeking corroboration of their accounts is a necessary part of your reporting, and doesn’t mean that you view them with suspicion. You may also need to prepare sources for the nastiness that can erupt in comments sections and on social media, and offer them some emotional support if and when that happens.</p><p>It’s also important to remember that the targets of an investigation are people, too. You should treat them fairly: Many news organizations have “no surprises” policies which mean that every key fact or allegation in a story must be explained to the person involved before publication, and they must be given opportunity to comment.</p><p>When approaching a source who may not emerge in a good light from your reporting, always think: Why would this person want to speak to me? Often, they will at least want their side of the story to be told. So frame your interview request in terms of giving them that opportunity, remembering that this must be a sincere offer. Also, go into your interviews with an open mind, and you may find that your view of the situation may shift once you’ve spoken to all of the interested parties.</p><h5 id="personal-narratives-have-enormous-power"><a name="personal-narratives-have-enormous-power" href="#personal-narratives-have-enormous-power"></a>Personal narratives have enormous power</h5><p>People may help you find the story. They may also <em>be</em> the story, or at least provide its narrative arc. The Garda, Children’s Heart Institute, and Valley Fever story, in particular, all made powerful use of personal narratives.</p><p>I’m a strong advocate of using data and analysis in journalism, so that you’re telling stories that reflect real trends, not isolated anecdotes. But most readers don’t relate to numbers in the same way that they relate to visceral personal narratives. There’s a general lesson, here: “Show, don’t tell.”</p><p>The sweet spot for this type of journalism is when you have the data and documents that make your story watertight, but can you tell it through compelling personal narratives.</p><h5 id="public-records:-file-early-and-often,-and-think-creatively"><a name="public-records:-file-early-and-often,-and-think-creatively" href="#public-records:-file-early-and-often,-and-think-creatively"></a>Public records: File early and often, and think creatively</h5><p>Public records requests are quick and easy to file, once you know how. They can be key sources for major investigations, as in the case of West Virgina Opiods story, which dependended on the reporter obtaining correspondence between the DEA and the West Virgina Attorney General, which included the drug shipping records that revealed the key role played by drug wholesalers in supplying an astonishing number of pills to pharmacies in the worst-affected parts of the state.</p><p>Get used to filing records requesrs as a matter of course for regular beat reporting, and think creatively about how any person or organization you are interested in may interact with any public body that is subject to federal or state public records laws.</p><p>As science reporters, it’s especially useful to remember that public universities are subject to state public records laws. <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemlee/brian-wansink-cornell-p-hacking">This story</a> that revealed how the career of Cornell food scientist Brian Wansink was a case study in <em>p</em>-hacking is another interesting example. Cornell is a private school, so my colleague Stephanie Lee couldn’t get his emails from there. But one of his most frequent collaborators worked at New Mexico State University, and that institution provided a trove of email correspondence.</p><h5 id="tax-records-for-non-profits/sec-filings-for-publicly-traded-companies"><a name="tax-records-for-non-profits/sec-filings-for-publicly-traded-companies" href="#tax-records-for-non-profits/sec-filings-for-publicly-traded-companies"></a>Tax records for non-profits/SEC filings for publicly traded companies</h5><p>We discussed the information on CEO salary in the opioid piece and the information on Garda’s revenue obtained from tje Canadian financial authorities. US companies that are publicly traded must file annual reports and other documents to the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>. These can reveal information that is impossible/hard to obtain elswhere.</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations">tax-exempt</a> nonprofits have to file an annual report to the Internal Revenue Service, known as a Form 990, which will contain lots of useful financial and other information.</p><p>We will look at backgrounding companies and nonprofits in next week’s class.</p><h5 id="enterprise-data-reporting"><a name="enterprise-data-reporting" href="#enterprise-data-reporting"></a>Enterprise data reporting</h5><p>Government or other databases can be put to good journalistic uses, and most of the time, this need not involve sophisticated statistical analysis.</p><p>We discussed the data analysis involved in the Garda, Children’s Heart Institute, and FDA drug approval stories. A key consideration in data analysis in journalism is “Compared to what?” What is your reference point to show your audience that an alarming-sounding statistic really is alarming? For the Garda story, the reporters used Department of Transportation data on collisions involving large trucks to show that Garda’s had more crashes, and more per mile driven, than those operated by its closest competitors. For the Children’s Heart Institute story, the reporters analysed hospital admissions and discharge data to show that bad outcomes from surgery indeed rose markedly at the time that their sources were telling them the hospital started having problems.</p><p>Reporting with data and documents often goes hand-in-hand, and can lead you to people who have individual stories to tell.</p><h5 id="rigor-and-transparency-in-reporting-using-data-and-documents"><a name="rigor-and-transparency-in-reporting-using-data-and-documents" href="#rigor-and-transparency-in-reporting-using-data-and-documents"></a>Rigor and transparency in reporting using data and documents</h5><p>The stories we looked at varied in the amount of detail provided on their methods, where data analysis. Full transparency is good practice. Increasingly news organizations, including the <a href="https://github.com/datadesk">Los Angeles Times</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews">BuzzFeed News</a> are routinely publising the data and analysis code behind their stories.</p><p>Notably Tampa Bay Times did this for its heart surgery analysis. High Country News also <a href="https://github.com/HCNData/landgrabu-data">published the data</a> underlying its story on land acquisition from Native American tribes and bands by land grant universities.</p><p>Similarly, documents supporting reporting can be published and annotated using <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/">DocumentCloud</a>. We’ll look at this in  a couple of weeks.</p><p>We also discussed how the analyses underlying several of the stories we discussed were reviewed by an expert. This kind of informal peeer review can be important in helping to “bullet proof” a story. It also helps to adopt widely used, tried-and-tested methods that are well understood. Investigative journalism is not a good venue for novel, experimental methods that are likely to be challenged.</p><p>High County News went further in its story on university land grabs, with most of the research being conducted by an academic historian who worked on the project. Academic collaborations can be fruitful, but bear in mind that the goals and timescales of academic research and journalism do differ. It’s important to set out the ground rules for any collaboration beforehand.</p><h5 id="turn-interviews-into-data"><a name="turn-interviews-into-data" href="#turn-interviews-into-data"></a>Turn interviews into data</h5><p>If you conduct organized, structured interviews with enough people, you can turn them into data, as well as providing color and personal narrative for a story. This was very effectively used in the Garda story to quantify the safety problems reported by 56 former and current drivers.</p><h5 id="public-accountability-versus-personal-privacy"><a name="public-accountability-versus-personal-privacy" href="#public-accountability-versus-personal-privacy"></a>Public accountability versus personal privacy</h5><p>This often creates tensions in public-service journalism. We discussed <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html">HIPAA</a> and the confidentiality of medical records. People who are willing to talk about their experiences can also be found through patient advocacy groups or lawsuits. They may be willing to forgo their privacy rights and share confidential records with you. Notice that the story on the Children’s Heart Institute specifically mentioned some of the children’s medical records. They would have been obtained in this way.</p><p>Death certificates and coroners/medical examiners reports are public.</p><h5 id="court-documents"><a name="court-documents" href="#court-documents"></a>Court documents</h5><p>These can be a treasure trove of information if the documents are not sealed from public view by the court. The Valley Fever story from Mother Jones seemed to have drawn heavily on the class action lawsuit against the California Department of Corrections mentioned in the piece.</p><p>Search for federal court cases at <a href="https://www.pacer.gov/">PACER</a> (you will need to sign up for an account and pay a modest sum for any documents you download). Some states have centralized searches for their courts but in many cases you will have to go to individual court websites to find the documents you need. In others, you may actually need to visit the courthouse. We’ll cover researching court documents in the coming weeks.</p><h5 id="use-your-own-expert-knowledge"><a name="use-your-own-expert-knowledge" href="#use-your-own-expert-knowledge"></a>Use your own expert knowledge</h5><p>As you gain experience, you will become an “expert” on the beats you cover. Use this expertise, and combine it with a critical journalistic sense to start doing a little digging if things “don’t smell right.”</p><p>This was key to John Carrryrou’s decision to start digging into Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos for the Wall Street Journal. The story we discussed was the start of one of the most stunning investigations of science, technology, and business in recent years, leading to criminal charges.</p><h5 id="build-on-the-work-of-others"><a name="build-on-the-work-of-others" href="#build-on-the-work-of-others"></a>Build on the work of others</h5><p>It’s perfectly OK to build on the work of other journalists. The Garda story identified collisions by the compmany’s trucks in part through press reports. Of course, if you use another news organization’s work as a starting point for your own, you should be careful to attribute these sources.</p><h5 id="" no-comment"-can-be-as-revealing-as-a-comment"=""><a name="" no-comment"-can-be-as-revealing-as-a-comment"="" href="#"></a>“No comment” can be as revealing as a comment</h5><p>Many of these stories detailed the efforts the reporters went to to interview the targets of the investigation, often to be denied. This is an important part of your reporting. We also discussed how BuzzFeed News approached Leonardo De Caprio, a celebrity supporter of WWF, before publication. This provided an opportunity for public pressure to build on him after publication, and for that to in turn put pressure on WWF to address the issues covered.</p><h5 id="financial-disclosures/following-the-money/conflicts-of-interest"><a name="financial-disclosures/following-the-money/conflicts-of-interest" href="#financial-disclosures/following-the-money/conflicts-of-interest"></a>Financial disclosures/following the money/conflicts of interest</h5><p>The Los Angeles Times story on drug approval noted the financial interest of FDA advisory committee members, and noted political contributions from drug companies.</p><p>Financial disclosures can be very revealing, and are required in many circumstances. Payments to doctors from drug and medical device manufacturers are declared in the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/openpayments/">Open Payments</a> database.</p><p>Academic and government scientists may be required to make financial disclosures. <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/research-graduate-studies/_files/research/policies/documents/coipolicy.pdf">Here</a>, <a href="https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2500558/PHS_COI">here</a> and <a href="https://www.ucop.edu/research-policy-analysis-coordination/policies-guidance/conflict-of-interest/index.html">here</a>, for example, are some links on financial disclosure policy for University of California faculty.</p><p>And don’t forget the competing interests sections of published scientific papers. While they aren’t always adhered to as closely as they should, many journals now have policies requiring disclosure by authors of relevant financial interests.</p><h5 id="watch-and-record-how-websites-change"><a name="watch-and-record-how-websites-change" href="#watch-and-record-how-websites-change"></a>Watch and record how websites change</h5><p>The Theranos story noted how the company made changes to its website as the reporting continued. We will discuss how to monitor such changes in a future class.</p><h3 id="other-sources/issues-we-didn't-discuss-explicitly"><a name="other-sources/issues-we-didn't-discuss-explicitly" href="#other-sources/issues-we-didn't-discuss-explicitly"></a>Other sources/issues we didn’t discuss explicitly</h3><h5 id="legislation-and-regulations"><a name="legislation-and-regulations" href="#legislation-and-regulations"></a>Legislation and regulations</h5><p>Laws and regulations change. The latter are issued subsequently, may be subject to revision, and determine how laws are implemented. You can review federal law <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/uscode">here</a>. Proposed regulations are published in the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/">Federal Register</a> and at <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/">Regulations.gov</a>. Individual states will have their own documentation of legislation and regulations.</p><h5 id="good-sources-of-reports-etc"><a name="good-sources-of-reports-etc" href="#good-sources-of-reports-etc"></a>Good sources of reports etc</h5><p>Reports from government agencies, think tanks, or other bodies can be goldmines of information. Here are some sources of reports that I find most useful:</p><ul>
<li><p>Reports from the National Academies (Sciences, Medicine, and Engineering). Search and browse them <a href="http://www.nap.edu/">here</a>. Acting as the National Research Council, the academies advise on government decision-making and public policy.</p>
</li><li><p>The <a href="http://www.gao.gov/">Government Accountability Office</a> is a watchdog agency that works for Congress, conducting investigations on a wide range of issues. The <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/">Congressional Budget Office</a> provides non-partisan analysis of the budgetary implications of bills/policies.</p>
</li><li><p>Investigations and hearings conducted by Congressional committees (e.g. <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings">here</a> are recent hearings of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is involved with health, environment and energy), as can staffers working for these committees. But bear in mind that the work of Congressional committees will be influenced by political agendas, especially that of the majority party.</p>
</li><li><p>Federal government departments and agencies typically have an Inspector General (e.g. <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/">here</a> for Health and Human Services, which covers NIH, FDA, CDC), which serves as an independent watchdog, investigating complaints, allegations of fraud/waste etc.</p>
</li></ul><p>Bear in mind that some think tanks, such as the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/">Pew Research Center</a> (which describes itself as a “fact tank”) are nonpartisan. Others may describe themselves as nonpartisan, but have pronounced idealogical biases. So do some background research into their funding and how they are viewed by other stakeholders.</p><h5 id="don't-forget-the-scientific-literature"><a name="don't-forget-the-scientific-literature" href="#don't-forget-the-scientific-literature"></a>Don’t forget the scientific literature</h5><p>As science reporters, you should be well placed to gather all the published studies that are going to be relevant to your study. Several of the stories we discussed, notably the superbugs story, made extensive use of the scientific literature.</p><p>So as you explore other sources of data and documents, don’t forget to do scientific literature searches. Scientific papers can also be used in other ways, such as to determine sources of researchers’ funding from the acknowledgments section and conflict-of-interest statements.</p><h5 id="even-if-your-story-is-local,-don't-think-parochially"><a name="even-if-your-story-is-local,-don't-think-parochially" href="#even-if-your-story-is-local,-don't-think-parochially"></a>Even if your story is local, don’t think parochially</h5><p>Always look for context and comparisons.
