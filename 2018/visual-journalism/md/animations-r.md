# Iteration and animation: Loops, GIFs, and videos

In today's class, we will make animated GIFs and videos from charts made in R using **ggplot2**. This depends on connecting R to two software libraries, [**ImageMagick**](http://imagemagick.org/script/index.php) (for processing images, including GIFs), and **[FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/)** (for processing video). See the [software](software.html) page for installation instructions.


### The data we will use today

Download the data for this session from [here](data/week14.zip), unzip the folder and place it on your desktop. It contains the following folders and files:

- `nations.csv` Data from the World Bank Indicators portal, as used in week 3 and subsequently.
- `warming.csv` [NASA data](http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/) on the annual average global temperature, from 1880 to 2015, compared the the average from 1951-1980.
- `maps` Folder containing individual frames, from 1880 to 2015, each showing annual average temperatures across the globe, from 1880 to 2015, again compared the the average from 1951-1980. These were made from NASA data, using [this software](http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/).
- `charts` `combined` Empty folders into which we will save individual frames from which to make a video animation.

### Setting up

Launch RStudio, create a new RScript, and set the working directory to the folder with your downloaded data by selecting `Session>Set Working Directory>To Source File Location`. Save the script as `week14.R`.

#### Install devtools and gganimate packages

We are going to animate **ggplot2** graphics using the **[gganimate](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate)** package, which is an [extension](http://www.ggplot2-exts.org/) to **ggplot2**. It depends upon ImageMagick and FFmpeg to make GIFs and videos.

**gganimate** is available on GitHub. To install from there, you first need to install the [**devtools**](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package.

```R
# first install devtools
install.packages("devtools")

# then gganimate
devtools::install_github("dgrtwo/gganimate")
```

#### Load the packages we will use today

```R
# load required packages
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
library(scales)
library(dplyr)
```

Apart from **gganimate**, we have encountered all of these packages in previous weeks.


### Make a Gapminder-style animated bubble chart

In week 8, we made the following chart, showing GDP per capita, life expectancy at birth and population for the world's nations in 2015:

![](./img/class8_22.png)

This was the code to generate that chart:

```r
# load data
nations <- read_csv("nations.csv")

# filter for 2015 data only
nations2015 <- nations %>%
  filter(year == 2015)

# make bubble chart
ggplot(nations2015, aes(x = gdp_percap, y = life_expect)) +
  xlab("GDP per capita") +
  ylab("Life expectancy at birth") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12, base_family = "Georgia") +
  geom_point(aes(size = population, color = region), alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_size_area(guide = FALSE, max_size = 15) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar) +
  stat_smooth(formula = y ~ log10(x), se = FALSE, size = 0.5, color = "black", linetype="dotted") +
  scale_color_brewer(name = "", palette = "Set2") +
  theme(legend.position=c(0.8,0.4))
```

Some reminders about what this code does:

 - `scale_size_area` ensures that the size of the circles scales by their area according to the population data, up to the specified `max_size`; `guide = FALSE` within the brackets of this function prevents a legend for size being drawn.

 - `labels = dollar` from **scales** formats the X axis labels as currency in dollars.

 - `stat_smooth` works like `geom_smooth` but allows you to use a `formula` to specify the type of curve to use for to trend line fitted to the data, here a logarithmic curve.

Now we will use **gganimate** to generate an animation of the chart, from 1990 to 2015. Here is the code:

```R
nations_chart <- ggplot(nations, aes(x = gdp_percap, y = life_expect, frame = year)) +
  xlab("GDP per capita") +
  ylab("Life expectancy at birth") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16, base_family = "Georgia") +
  geom_point(aes(size = population, color = region), alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_size_area(guide = FALSE, max_size = 20) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar) +
  stat_smooth(aes(group = year), formula = y ~ log10(x), se = FALSE, size = 0.5, color = "black", linetype="dotted") +
  scale_color_brewer(name = "", palette = "Set2") +
  theme(legend.position=c(0.8,0.4))
```

Running this code will create an R object of type `gg` called `nations_chart`.

Now display it in the `Viewer` panel by running the following:

```R
gganimate(nations_chart)
```

This should be the result:

![](./img/nations.gif)

#### How the code works

I made a couple of small changes to the **ggplot2** code from the static graphic to optimise the appearance of the animation, increasing both the `base_size` for the text, and the `max_size` for the scaled circles.

The most important change, however, is in the initial `ggplot` function, which now includes `frame = year`. In the animation, this is the code that creates a separate chart for each year in the data.

Also notice that the code that creates the trend line now includes `aes(group = year)`. This is needed if we want to create a separate trend line for each year. Without this, a single trend line would be calculated for all the data across all the years, and would be static across the animation.

#### Save as a GIF and a video

Having made an animation, we can now save it as a GIF or a video:

```R

# save as a GIF
gganimate(nations_chart, "nations.gif", ani.width = 750, ani.height = 500, interval = 0.2)

# save as a video 
gganimate(nations_chart, "nations.mp4", ani.width = 800, ani.height = 450, interval = 0.1)
```

You can use the options `ani.width` and `ani.height` to set the dimensions, in pixels, of the animation; `interval` sets the interval between the frames, in seconds (the default is 1 second). For the video, I have set the ratio between width and height at 16:9, consistent with YouTube format.

Here is the video:

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
    <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="img/nations.mp4"></iframe>
</div>

### Add a pause to the final frame on a GIF

When making GIFs, it is often a good idea to add a longer pause on the final frame before the animation repeats. You can do this with the following code:

```R
# increase delay on final frame
system("convert nations.gif \\( +clone -set delay 300 \\) +swap +delete  nations_with_pause.gif")
```

This code uses the `system` function to send ImageMagick code to your wider computer system. It has same effect as if you ran the ImageMagick code in the Terminal.

`convert` is one of the main commands in ImageMagick, used to convert between image formats as well as to manipulate images in a variety of ways. Here, `delay 300` increases the delay on the final frame to 3 seconds.

Here is the revised GIF:

![](./img/nations_with_pause.gif)

### Make a cumulative animation of historical global average temperature

For the Gapminder-style video, we displayed only the data for the year in question in each frame. In some cases, however, you may want to animate by adding data with each frame, and leaving the previously added data in place.

We will explore that now by making an animation of the dot-and-line chart in [this video](https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedScience/videos/753675331429028/).

Here is the code to make a static version of the chart:

```R
# load data
warming <- read_csv("warming.csv")

# set color palette and sequence of values to apply it to
pal <- c("#313695","#4575b4","#74add1","#abd9e9","#e0f3f8","#ffffbf","#fee090","#fdae61","#f46d43","#d73027","#a50026")
vals <- seq(-2, 2, length = 11)

# draw chart
ggplot(warming, aes(x = year, y = annual)) +
  geom_line(colour="black") +
  geom_point(shape = 21, colour="black", aes(fill=annual), size=5, stroke=1) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1880,2015)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(-0.5,1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = pal, values = vals, rescaler = function(x, ...) x, oob = identity, guide=FALSE) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Difference from 1951-1980 (ÂºC)") +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16, family="Georgia"))
```
This should be the result:

![](./img/warming.jpeg)

The file `warming.csv` contains the fields `year` and `annual`, the latter being the global annual average temperature, compared to the 1951-1980 average.

This code uses a palette of colors running from cool blues, through neutral yellows, to warm reds, and applies them to a sequence of values running from -2 to +2. This is so the chart uses the same color palette as the maps we will animate later on, and combine with the chart.

The palette is then applied with the function `scale_fill_gradientn`, see [here](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_gradient.html) for more.

As this is a dot-and-line chart, it includes both `geom_line` and `geom_point` layers. Notice that the `geom_point` function also defines a numbered `shape`: `21` is a circle with a filled area, see [here](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Shapes_and_line_types/) for other options. By using this shape, we can set the outline `color` to black and then use an `aes` mapping to fill it with color from the selected palette, according to the values for the `annual` variable.

To animate this chart, adding a year with each frame, use the following code:

```R
# create the animation
warming_chart <- ggplot(warming, aes(x = year, y = annual, frame = year, cumulative = TRUE)) +
  geom_line(colour="black") +
  geom_point(shape = 21, colour="black", aes(fill=annual), size=5, stroke=1) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1880,2015)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(-0.5,1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = pal, values = vals, rescaler = function(x, ...) x, oob = identity, guide=FALSE) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Difference from 1951-1980 (ÂºC)") +
  theme(text=element_text(size=16, family="Georgia"))

# run in the viewer
gganimate(warming_chart, interval = 0.1)
```

This time, the initial `ggplot` function also contains the code `cumulative = TRUE`, which adds one year of data with each frame, and leaves the previously added data in place.

This should be the result:

![](./img/warming.gif)

Again, we can save as GIF and video:

```R
# save as GIF and video
gganimate(warming_chart, "warming.gif", ani.width = 750, ani.height = 500, interval = 0.1)
gganimate(warming_chart, "warming.mp4", ani.width = 800, ani.height = 450, interval = 0.1)
```

### Combine the chart with maps to make a composite animation of the historical temperature record

To replicate [this video](https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedScience/videos/753675331429028/), we need to combine the maps in the `maps` folder with individual images of each frame of the chart. So rather than using `gganimate`, we will now write a **for loop** to save the individual frames.

#### For loops: How they work

This code should help explain how a for loop works:

```R
# make a list of years, from 1880 to 2015
years <- c(1880:2015)

# for loop to print each year to the console, pausing for one second each time
for (y in years) {
  print(y)
  Sys.sleep(1) 
}
```
The output should begin:

```CSS
[1] 1880
[1] 1881
[1] 1882
[1] 1883
[1] 1884
[1] 1885
[1] 1886
[1] 1887
```

The first line of code creates a list of integers, from 1880 to 2015, as an R object called `years`.

This part of the code iterates through each entry in the list: `for (y in years)`.

For each iteration, it executes the code in the curly brackets, which here prints `y`, and then pauses for a second.

#### Use a for loop to draw and save a chart for each year

This code uses the same principle to draw and save a chart for each year:

```R
# make a list of years, from 1880 to 2015
years <- c(1880:2015)

# loop to make a chart for each year
for (y in years) {
  tmp <- warming %>%
    filter(year <= y)
  chart <- ggplot(tmp, aes(x=year,y=annual)) %>%
    + geom_line(colour="black") %>%
    + geom_point(shape = 21, colour="black", aes(fill=annual), size=5, stroke=1) %>%
    + scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1880,2015)) %>%
    + scale_y_continuous(limits=c(-0.5,1)) %>%
    + theme_minimal() %>%
    + scale_fill_gradientn(colors = pal, values=vals, rescaler = function(x, ...) x, oob = identity, guide=FALSE) %>%
    + xlab("") %>%
    + ylab("Difference from 1951-1980 (ÂºC)") %>%
    + theme(text=element_text(size=16,family="Georgia"))
  ggsave(file=paste0("charts/",y,".jpg"), plot = chart, width = 8, height = 4.5, units = "in", dpi=300)
  print(paste0("processing: ",y))
}
```

#### What this code does

For each year, `y`, the code first makes an R object called `tmp`, which is the `warming` data frame, filtered for all years equal or less to `y`.

Then it creates an R object called `chart`, which is a static **ggplot2** chart drawn from that data.

It then saves that chart using the `ggsave` function, at the defined dimensions and resolution, before printing a message to the R console giving a progress update on the loop.

This code makes use of the R function `paste0`. As we saw in week 13, it is the equivalent of `=concatenate` in a spreadsheet formula, appending text into a single string. The elements to be combined are separated by commas, and can be either text, written in quote marks, or a named variable or object that contains text, or a number that can be rendered as text.

So when `y` is `1880`, `(paste0("charts/",y,".jpg")` is `"charts/1880.jpg"`. This is how the individual charts get saved with the appropriate names in the `charts` folder.

#### Combine the charts and maps into a single frame for each year

Again, we will use a for loop. This time the loop will be written in R, but it  will send ImageMagick code to your wider computer system using the `system` function.

```R
# combine the maps and charts with ImageMagick, add year label to each frame
for (y in years) {
  system(paste0("convert charts/",y,".jpg maps/map",y,".jpg -geometry +305+72 -composite -pointsize 100 -font Georgia -annotate +2000+1120 ",y," combined/img",y,".jpg"))
  print(paste0("processing: ",y))
}
```
Here's what the ImageMagick code looks like when `y` is 1880:

```SQL
convert charts/1880.jpg maps/map1880.jpg -geometry +305+68 -composite -pointsize 100 -font Georgia -annotate +2000+1120 1880 combined/img1880.jpg
```

This part of the code takes the two named files, and creates a composite, layering the second over the first with its top left hand corner 305 pixels from the left and 68 pixels from the top of the image:

```SQL
charts/1880.jpg maps/map1880.jpg -geometry +305+68 -composite
```

This part of the code adds an annotation with the text "1880" to the image, 2000 pixels from the left and 1200 pixels from the top, with the defined size and font face:

```SQL
-pointsize 100 -font Georgia -annotate +2000+1120 1880
```

Finally, this completes the `convert` command, saving the result as a new file in the `combined` folder:

```SQL
combined/img1880.jpg
```

See [here](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/convert.php) for ImageMagick `convert` options; [here](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-tools.php), [here](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php), and [here](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) for more on using the library.


#### Combine the frames into a GIF and video

First make a GIF with ImageMagick:

```R
# make a GIF with ImageMagick
system("convert -delay 10 combined/*.jpg warming2.gif")
```

This code creates a GIF called `warming2.gif` ; `-delay` defines the interval between each frame in hundredths of a second, so here the delay is 0.1 seconds.

Now make a video with FFmpeg:

```R
# make a video with FFmpeg
system("ffmpeg -f image2 -start_number 1880 -i combined/img%d.jpg -vf 'scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2' -b:a 64000k warming2.mp4")
```

This code combines the images into a video called `warming2.mp4`.

Don't worry too much about the details of this code, other than to know that it works.

`image2` creates a video from a sequence of images. Here the code looks for files with the format `combined/img%d.jpg`, where `%d` is an integer, starting at `1880`; `%03d` would look for file names ending with a number with three decimal places, for example `combined/img.001.jpg`.


Having made a video, you can change its speed like this:

```R
# change the speed of the video
system("ffmpeg -i warming2.mp4 -vf 'setpts=2*PTS' warming3.mp4")
```
This code creates a new video with half the speed of the first; `'setpts=4*PTS'` would run at a  quarter of the speed, and so on.

See [here](http://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html) for full documentation for FFmpeg.

#### Create smoother animations, using tweenr

Look back at the first GIF we made from the `nations` data. Wouldn't it be nicer if all the points moved smoothly, rather than jolting from year to year? It is possible to achieve this effect, using an R package called **[tweenr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tweenr/tweenr.pdf)**, which can "interpolate" data -- provide the "missing" values -- for an animation with more frames.

First, install and load **tweenr**

```R
# install and load tweenr
install.packages("tweenr")
library(tweenr)
```
To interpolate data using **tweenr's** `tween_elements` function, first create a data frame with the fields `x` for the co-ordinate on the X axis, `y` for the co-ordinate on the y axis, `time` for the data that will be used to make the frames, and `id` for the unique identifier for each point. You also need a variable called `ease`, which defines the method to use for the interpolation: `"linear"` will achieve a smooth, steady animation.

This code prepares the nations data:

```R
# prepare data
nations_edit <- nations %>%
  arrange(country, year) %>%
  select(gdp_percap,life_expect,year,country) %>%
  rename(x=gdp_percap,y=life_expect,time=year,id=country) %>%
  mutate(ease="linear")
```

The new data frame `nations_edit` should look like this:

![](./img/class14_1.jpg)

Now run the tween:

```R
# tween
nations_tween <- tween_elements(nations_edit, "time", "id", "ease", nframes = 300)
```

The new data frame `nations_tween` should look like this:

![](./img/class14_2.jpg)

The function `tween_elements` creates new variables called `.frame`, one for each of the specified number of frames, and `.group`, which corresponds to the `id` in the previous data frame, here the country names. It calculates new `x`, `y`, and `time` values for each frame. Scroll down and you will see that many of the `time` values now include decimal fractions.

To make the animated chart, we need to join to the original data, so we will now create `year` and `country` variables, to match against the original data:

```R
# create year and country fields, for join
nations_tween <- nations_tween %>%
  mutate(year = round(time),
         country = .group)
```

The data should now look like this:

![](./img/class14_3.jpg)

Now run the join:

```R
# join
nations_tween <- inner_join(nations_tween,nations)
```

The data should now look like this:

![](./img/class14_4.jpg)

Now we can make the animated chart using **gganimate**:

```R
# make animated chart
nations_tween_chart <- ggplot(nations_tween, aes(x = x, y = y, frame = .frame)) +
  xlab("GDP per capita") +
  ylab("Life expectancy at birth") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16, base_family = "Georgia") +
  geom_point(aes(size = population, color = region), alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_size_area(guide = FALSE, max_size = 20) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar) +
  scale_color_brewer(name = "", palette = "Set2") +
  theme(legend.position=c(0.8,0.4))

# run in the viewer
gganimate(nations_tween_chart, title_frame = FALSE, interval = 0.05)
```
This should be the result:

![](./img/nations2.gif)

Notice that the `gganimate` function this time includes `title_frame = FALSE`, which prevents the frame number being shown on each chart. In practice, you would want to display the year on each frame, rather than the frame numbers, which are not informative in this case.

This is best done with ImageMagick. So rather than using **gganimate**, after creating the tweened data frame `nations_tween` and joining to the original data, you might instead generate individual image files for each frame using a loop, and then annotate each one.

In this case there are 12 frames for each year, so you would need to annotate the first 12 frames with "1990", the next 12 with "1991," and so on.

You could do that like this, assuming a list `frames` with each of the frame numbers, and a folder called `edited` to save the annotated frames:

```R
# add labels for year
for (f in frames[1:12]) {
  system(paste0("convert charts/",f,".jpg pointsize 100 -font Georgia -annotate +2000+1120 1990 edited/img",f,".jpg"))
  print(paste0("processing: ",f))
}

for (f in frames[13:24]) {
  system(paste0("convert charts/",f,".jpg pointsize 100 -font Georgia -annotate +2000+1120 1991 edited/img",f,".jpg"))
  print(paste0("processing: ",f))
}

# and so on
```
