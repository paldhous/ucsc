#UCSC SciCom: Visual journalism

##Data visualization

In these classes, we will cover basic principles of data visualization, acquiring and cleaning data, and make static, interactive, and animated charts.

### Schedule

- #### Jan 9: [Basic principles of data analysis and visualization](principles.html)
How to ask questions of data, and present the results visually in ways that the human brain intuitively understands.

- #### Jan 11: [Finding and downloading data](acquiring-data.html)
Where and how to find data online. Tips and tricks for downloading unruly data, including browser extensions to  extract data from web tables and download from multiple files *en masse*.

- #### Jan 16: [Processing and cleaning data](cleaning-data.html)
We will use [Open Refine](http://openrefine.org/) to process and clean “dirty data,” and learn how to obtain a script to repeat a data processing recipe on data in the same format.

- #### Jan 18: [Basic charts with Plotly](basic-charts.html)
 We'll use the [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) web app to make a variety of static and interactive charts.

- #### Feb 6: [Processing data with R](data-processing-r.html)
Introduction to [R](http://www.r-project.org/), [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com/) and the [dplyr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) package for data processing.

- #### Feb 8: [Static charts with R](static-charts-r.html)
Making charts with the [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) R package.

- #### Feb 13: [Interactive charts with R](interactive-charts-r.html)
We will explore R packages called [htmlwidgets](http://www.htmlwidgets.org/) that allow you to create JavaScript visualizations straight from your data with a minimum of coding.

- #### Feb 15: [Animation: GIFs and videos from R](animations-r.html)
We will explore how to make animation frames by writing loops in R, and use [ImageMagick](http://imagemagick.org/script/index.php), [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) and the [gganimate](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate) package to make animated GIFs and videos.
