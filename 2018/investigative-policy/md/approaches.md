### Thoughts arising from discussion

##### Think about the human sources who can help you

In some of the articles we discussed, the reporters may have been tipped off to the initial story by an interested party — who may also have provided documents or data. Whistleblowers are very important for investigative journalists.

At this stage in your career, you probably won't have whistleblowers eager to hand you a story to pursue. But there are still plenty of people who will be motivated to help you. Academics and non-governmental organizations with an interest in the issue can be very useful, as can attorneys representing a party in a lawsuit. Of course, you need to be aware that most interested parties have an agenda, which you must bear in mind. But the information they can provide may still be very useful.

Former employees of government agencies or companies, freed from the constraints of "party line" or official silence, can be very good sources. Both the Pultizer-winning story on FDA drug approval, and the story about Wildlife Services' killing of pets and  protected species, made heavy use of ex-employees. [LinkedIn Premium](https://premium.linkedin.com/) is very useful for finding and communicating with these people. This can be free for [journalists](https://premium.linkedin.com/).

It's very important to remember that your sources are people, who should be treated with care and respect. Most people don't necessarily understand how journalism works, and what may happen when an article is published. So take time to explain the process, for example so that they realize that seeking corroboration of their accounts is a necessary part of your reporting, and doesn't mean you view them with suspicion. You may also need to prepare sources for the nastiness that can erupt in comments sections and on social media, and offer them some emotional support if and when that happens.

It's also important to remember that the targets of an investigation are people, too. You should treat them fairly: Many news organizations have "no surprises" policies which mean that every key fact or allegation in a story must be explained to the person involved before publication, and they must be given opportunity to comment.

When approaching a source who may not emerge in a good light from your reporting, always think: Why would this person want to speak to me? Often, they will at least want their side of the story to be told. So frame your interview request in terms of giving them that opportunity, remembering that this must be a sincere offer. Also, go into your interviews with an open mind, and you may find that your view of the situation may shift once you've spoken to all of the interested parties.

To stress what will become a refrain from me: Hitting the phones and talking to as many informed sources and people actually affected by the issue you are investigating as you can is crucial!

#####Personal narratives have enormous power

People will help you find the story. They may also *be* the story, or at least provide its narrative arc.

I'm a strong advocate of using data and analysis in journalism, but most readers don't relate to numbers in the same way that they relate to visceral personal narratives. Lengthy discussions of policy and procedure can also turn readers off: We discussed how the High Country News story on sexual harrassment in the National Park Service sagged in the lengthy section on the reporting process. The article was much more effective when it showed how this process failed through the women's stories. There's a general lesson, here: "Show, don't tell."

The sweet spot for this type of journalism is when you have the data and documents that make your story watertight, but can you tell it through compelling personal narratives. Look at how Reuters used Joseph Hines' experiences in its story on police employment contracts.

#####Public records: File early and often, and think creatively

Public records requests are quick and easy to file, once you know how. Get used to filing them as a matter of course, and think creatively about how any person or organization you are interested in may interact with any public body that is subject to federal or state public records laws. Notice how the story about edits to the National Park Service report on climate change sea level rise came not through a FOIA to the NPS, but rather through a state public records request to the University of Colorado at Boulder, where the author works.

As science reporters, it's especially useful to remember that public universities are subject to state public records laws. [This story](https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemlee/brian-wansink-cornell-p-hacking) that revealed how the career of Cornell food scientist Brian Wansink was a case study in *p*-hacking is another interesting example. Cornell is a private school, so my colleague Stephanie Lee couldn't get his emails from there. But one of his most frequent collaborators worked at New Mexico State University, and that institution provided a trove of email correspondence.

When it comes to public records, take inspiration from my BuzzFeed News colleague Jason Leopold, aka the "FOIA terrorist":

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Responses to all of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FOIA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FOIA</a> requests I filed in 2016 and 2017 (still waiting for the documents). <a href="https://t.co/X5iZqnrt4v">pic.twitter.com/X5iZqnrt4v</a></p>&mdash; Jason Leopold (@JasonLeopold) <a href="https://twitter.com/JasonLeopold/status/946763635791032320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Jason's [backstory](https://medium.com/matter/the-secret-to-getting-top-secret-secrets-1f693eaf609a) is interesting, a case of personal redemption through FOIA.

#####Enterprise data reporting

Government or other databases can be put to good journalistic uses, and most of the time, this need not involve sophisticated statistical analysis. The Los Angeles' Times' Food and Drug Administration drug approval series investigated deaths linked the drugs it investigated using the FDA's [Adverse Events Reporting System](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/), while BuzzFeed News selected the law enforcement agencies to target with its public records requests about "unfounded" rape allegations by analyzing the FBI's [Uniform Crime Reporting](https://ucr.fbi.gov/) data.

Reporting with data and documents often goes hand-in-hand. Given the limitations of the adverse events database, to produce counts of deaths linked to each drug, the *Los Angeles Times* would have obtained individual case safety reports using FOIA. After determining the law enforcement agencies with, BuzzFeed News then requested individual police investigation reports under state public records laws.

#####Structure documents/text into data

If you have a collection of documents, it may be possible to systematically extract information from them to create your own data. This was done to very good effect for Reuters' analysis of police employment contracts.

Text can be classified manually, as in that example, or in an automated way, as in [this recent analysis](https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/trump-twitter-wars) I did of a year on political Twitter under President Donald Trump.

#####Transparency in reporting using data and documents

We discussed how news organizations, including the [Los Angeles Times](https://github.com/datadesk) and [BuzzFeed News](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews), now publish the data and analysis behind their stories.

Similarly, documents supporting reporting can be published and annotated using [DocumentCloud](https://www.documentcloud.org/).

#####Court documents

These can be a treasure trove of information if the documents are not sealed from public view by the court. The Los Angeles Times made extensive use of both public and sealed -- presumably leaked to them -- court documents in its Oxycontin investigation.

Search for federal cases at [PACER](https://www.pacer.gov/) (you will need to sign up for an account and pay a modest sum for any documents you download). Some states have centralized searches for their courts but in many cases you will have to go to individual court websites to find the documents you need. In others, you may actually need to visit the courthouse.

#####Good sources of reports etc

Some of the stories we discussed mentioned reports from government agencies or other bodies. The Guardian story about CITES and the illegal wildlife trade was more of a synthesis than an original investigation, drawing from reports compiled by many different organizations.

Here are some sources of reports that I find most useful:

- Reports from the National Academies (Sciences, Medicine, and Engineering). Search and browse them [here](http://www.nap.edu/). Acting as the National Research Council, the academies advise on government decision-making and public policy.

- The [Government Accountability Office](http://www.gao.gov/) is a watchdog agency that works for Congress, conducting investigations on a wide range of issues. The [Congressional Budget Office](http://www.cbo.gov/) provides non-partisan analysis of the budgetary implications of bills/policies.

- Investigations and hearings conducted by Congressional committees (e.g. [here](https://energycommerce.house.gov/hearings-and-votes) are recent hearings of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is involved with health, environment and energy), as can staffers working for these committees. But bear in mind that the work of Congressional committees will be influenced by political agendas, especially that of the majority party.

- Federal government departments and agencies typically have an Inspector General (e.g. [here](http://oig.hhs.gov/) for Health and Human Services, which covers NIH, FDA, CDC), which serves as an independent watchdog, investigating complaints, allegations of fraud/waste etc.

#####Enforcement/inspection records

Agencies charged with enforcing laws or regulations will create a trail of documents that you can follow. Environmental enforcement actions were central to SA Today's investigation of lead in drinking water.

#####Financial disclosures/following the money

Financial disclosures can be very revealing, and are required in many circumstances. The Propublica story on levees, for instance, relied in part on disclosures required from lobbyists. Campaign finance records can also be very useful, especially when investigating people and organizations with political influence.

When reporting on scientists, remember that they may be required to make financial disclosures. [Here](http://www.ucop.edu/research-graduate-studies/_files/research/policies/documents/coipolicy.pdf), [here](http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2500558/PHS_COI) and [here](http://www.ucop.edu/research-policy-analysis-coordination/policies-guidance/conflict-of-interest/index.html), for example, are some links on financial disclosure policy for University of California faculty.

#####Public accountability versus personal privacy

This often creates tensions in public-service journalism. We discussed [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) and the confidentiality of medical records. Special protections also surround victims of sexual offenses, which helps explain why many police departments refused to provide documents for the BuzzFeed News rape story, and records involving children.

In some cases, personally identifying information may be redacted from public records. Other documents, such as death certificates, are public. People who are willing to talk about their experiences can often be found through patient advocacy groups, lawsuits etc. They may also be willing to forgo their privacy and share confidential records with you.

#####Don't forget the scientific literature

As science reporters, you should be well placed to gather all the published studies that are going to be relevant to your study. It was really striking how the fiction of Oxycontin being a reliably "12-hour drug" was clear from published studies.

So as you explore other sources of data and documents, don't forget to do scientific literature searches. Scientific papers can also be used in other ways, such as to determine sources of researchers' funding from the acknowledgments section and conflict-of-interest statements.

#####Use your own expert knowledge

As you gain experience, you will become an “expert” on the beats you cover. Use this expertise, and combine it with a critical journalistic sense to start doing a little digging if things "don't smell right." [Here](http://www.latimes.com/projects/oxycontin-about/), the lead reporter on *Los Angeles Times* investigation into Oxycontin explains how that story arose from years of reporting on addiction to prescription drugs.

####Some more things that didn't come up explicitly,  but are useful to consider:

#####Build on the work of others

It's perfectly OK to build on the work of other journalists. Of course, if you use their work as a starting point for your own, you should be careful to attribute these sources.

#####Even if your story is local, don't think parochially

Always look for context and comparisons. Compare to the rest of the state, nationally, or internationally. If you need to make comparisons between nations, the [World Bank](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/?tab=all) probably has what you need, its catalog containing data for more than 7,000 different measures, compiled by the bank and other agencies.

It is also often possible to transpose an approach done in one jurisdiction to another. I'd recommend signing up for the [Local Matters newsletter](https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/manage/optin?v=001jNS0O4Ui3OO7md-9Ryd0WOKdq14U-VfK9aIRH18MLku7VRyaaHESUptkwHw-8FO3X8Dhpw6_U4bO-hrpYrIzmYZy_m-F01qUfYYiFg0mDpo%3D), a roundup of local investigative/watchdog journalism, to get ideas.

#####Professional accreditation/licensing

Many professions are accredited or licensed by state government agencies. Doctors and state medical boards are the most obvious example, but there are many others. These records will usually be searchable online, and may include disciplinary actions. [Here](https://www.breeze.ca.gov/datamart/loginCADCA.do) is California's license search site, where you will find doctors and many other licensed professionals.

#####Trade/industry data

Some trade bodies collate information on their industries, and other organizations earn their living by collecting and analyzing industry data.

#####Meeting transcripts

If there was an official meeting, there will probably be minutes or a full transcript. These can be very useful documents.

#####Permits

Many activities require permits from federal, state, or local governments, and these should be public documents.

#####Tax records for non-profits/SEC filings for publicly traded companies

Even if an organization has [tax-exempt status as a non-profit/charity](http://www.irs.gov/Charities-&-Non-Profits/Charitable-Organizations/Exemption-Requirements-Section-501%28c%29%283%29-Organizations), it will still have to file an annual report to the Internal Revenue Service, known as a Form 990, which will contain lots of useful financial and other information.

Annual reports and other documents filed by companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission, as a legal requirement, can reveal information that is impossible/hards to obtain elswhere.

#####Budgets/contracts

If you need to find out how much a public project cost the information will usually be in government budgets or in contracts awarded. [USASpending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/Pages/Default.aspx) can be a good starting point for federal grants and contracts.

#####If appropriate, you can commission your own analysis

If you find an interested scientist, and the work isn’t enormously time-consuming or expensive to perform, this approach can be worth considering. 

You may also be able to structure your interviews so that, in effect, you perform your own survey with limited scope. But proper methodology is crucial, and seek expert advice. [This book](http://www.amazon.com/Precision-Journalism-Reporters-Introduction-Science/dp/0742510883) from Philip Meyer is a very good resource.


####And finally, remember why we do this work

Investigative journalism should serve the public. Its job is to hold those in positions of power or influence to account, to give voice to the voiceless, and to challenge and correct injustices. Journalism prizes and the admiration of colleagues are nice to have, but they should not be our primary motivators!
