If you have sensitive data that needs to be kept within your organization, you will need a license for the <a href="http://www.tableau.com/products/">Desktop version</a> of the software.</p><p>Tableau was developed for exploratory graphical data analysis, so it is a great tool for exploring a new dataset — filtering, sorting and aggregating the data in different ways while experimenting with various chart types.</p><p>Although Tableau was not designed as a publication tool, the ability to embed finished dashboards and stories on any web page has also allowed organizations that lack JavaScript coding expertise to create customized interactive online graphics.</p><h3 id="the-data-we-will-use"><a name="the-data-we-will-use" href="#the-data-we-will-use"></a>The data we will use</h3><p>Download the data for this session from <a href="data/tableau.zip">here</a>, unzip the folder and place it on your desktop. It contains two subfolders, with the following files:</p><h5 id="nations"><a name="nations" href="#nations"></a>Nations</h5><ul>
<li><code>nations.csv</code> Data from the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/all">World Bank Indicators</a> portal, which is an incredibly rich resource. Contains the following fields:<ul>

<li><p><code>storms.csv</code> Data on <a href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/Data_Storm.html">tropical storms and hurricanes</a> in the North Atlantic compiled by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). I have processed the <a href="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/hurdat2.html">raw data</a> to give the following fields for storms from 1990 onwards:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>name</code> Official name for each storm; unnamed storms are listed as Unnamed and also numbered.</li>

At this point, you can view the data, which will be labeled as follows:</p><ul>
<li>Text: <code>Abc</code></li>
<li>Numbers: <code>#</code></li>
<li>Dates: calendar symbol</li>
<li>Geography: globe symbol</li>
</ul><p>You can edit fields to give them the correct data type if there are any problems:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_2a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Once the data has loaded, click <code>Sheet 1</code> at bottom left and you should see a screen like this:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_3a.jpg" alt=""></p><h4 id="dimensions-and-measures:-categorical-and-continuous"><a name="dimensions-and-measures:-categorical-and-continuous" href="#dimensions-and-measures:-categorical-and-continuous"></a>Dimensions and measures: categorical and continuous</h4><p>The fields should appear in the <code>Data</code> panel at left. Notice that Tableau has divided the fields into <code>Dimensions</code> and <code>Measures</code>. These broadly correspond to categorical and continuous variables. Dimensions are fields containing text or dates, while measures contain numbers.</p><p>If any field appears in the wrong place, click the small downward-pointing triangle that appears when it is highlighted and select <code>Convert to Dimension</code> or <code>Convert to Measure</code> as required.</p><h4 id="shelves-and-show-me"><a name="shelves-and-show-me" href="#shelves-and-show-me"></a>Shelves and Show Me</h4><p>Notice that the main panel contains a series of “shelves,” called <code>Pages,</code> <code>Columns</code>, <code>Rows</code>, <code>Filters</code> and so on. Tableau charts and maps are made by dragging and dropping fields from the data into these shelves.</p><p>Over to the right you should see the <code>Show Me</code> panel, which will highlight chart types you can make from the data currently loaded into the <code>Columns</code> and <code>Rows</code> shelves. It is your go-to resource when experimenting with different visualization possibilities. You can open and close this panel by clicking on its title bar.</p><h4 id="columns-and-rows:-x-and-y-axes"><a name="columns-and-rows:-x-and-y-axes" href="#columns-and-rows:-x-and-y-axes"></a>Columns and rows: X and Y axes</h4><p>The starting point for creating any chart or map in Tableau is to place fields into <code>Columns</code> and <code>Rows</code>, which for most charts correspond to the X and Y axes, respectively. When making maps, longitude goes in <code>Columns</code> and latitude in <code>Rows</code>. If you display the data as a table, then these labels are self-explanatory.</p><h4 id="initial-questions-to-ask-this-data"><a name="initial-questions-to-ask-this-data" href="#initial-questions-to-ask-this-data"></a>Initial questions to ask this data</h4><p>I first approached the dataset with the following questions:</p><ul>
<li>What is the relationship between a nations’ wealth, measured as GDP per capita, and their citizens’ life expectancy?</li>
<li>How has this relationship changed over time?</li>
</ul><h4 id="make-a-bubble-chart-to-explore-the-relationship-between-wealth-and-life-expectancy,-and-animate-over-time"><a name="make-a-bubble-chart-to-explore-the-relationship-between-wealth-and-life-expectancy,-and-animate-over-time" href="#make-a-bubble-chart-to-explore-the-relationship-between-wealth-and-life-expectancy,-and-animate-over-time"></a>Make a bubble chart to explore the relationship between wealth and life expectancy, and animate over time</h4><p>From the morning session, you will remember that we can investigate relationships using a scatter plot. One would imagine that the people in wealthier countries would live healthier and longer lives. So we will put wealth on the X axis, as the presumed explanatory variable, and life expectancy on the Y.</p><p>First let’s rename these variables, so that their meaning is unambiguous. Hover over <code>Life Expect</code>, click on the small downward-pointing triangle that appeats, select <code>Rename</code> and call it <code>Life expectancy at birth (years)</code>. Similarly, change <code>Gdp Percap</code> to <code>GDP per capita</code>.</p><p>Now drag <code>GDP per capita</code> to  <code>Columns</code> and <code>Life expectancy at birth (years)</code> to <code>Rows</code>. Notice that this results in a chart with a single point:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_4a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>This is because Tableau’s default behavior is to aggregate continuous variables — in this case it has added up all the values in the dataset using the function <code>SUM</code>.</p><p>To override this behaviour, and see every single data point, select <code>Analysis</code> from the top menu and uncheck <code>Aggregate measures</code>. The chart should now look like this:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_5a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>However, removing aggregation disables some useful functions (more on this later), so select <code>Analysis</code> and check <code>Aggregate measures</code> once more. Hover over each of the measures in the <code>Columns</code> and <code>Rows</code> shelves, click on the downward-pointing triangle to open the dropdown menu, and change the aggregation from <code>Measure (Sum)</code> to <code>Measure (Average)</code>. The chart should looks like this:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_6a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Now drag <code>Country</code> to the <code>Detail</code> shelf under <code>Marks</code>. This creates a separate mark for each country, plotting the average values over the entire time period for each. The chart should now look like this:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_7a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>To show just one year’s data, and to animate the changes over time, drag <code>Year</code> into the <code>Pages</code> shelf. Notice that this both filters the data and adds controls to move through the years:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_8a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Although we are still aggregating the data using the function <code>AVG</code>, there is only one record per country, per year, so the chart is now plotting single values.</p><p>Experiment with the page controls, and notice that the chart goes blank in 2013 and 2014 — years for which there is no data. This is not desirable behavior, but we can prevent it by filtering those years out of the displayed data.</p><p>Hover over <code>Year</code> in the <code>Pages</code> shelf, click on the downward pointing trial and select <code>Filter...</code>. Uncheck the two years with missing data and click <code>OK</code>:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_8.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Now drag <code>Region</code> to <code>Color</code>, and the circles will be colored with Tableau’s default qualitative color scheme for categorical data. (Tableau’s qualitative color schemes are well designed, so there is no need to adopt a ColorBrewer scheme. However, it is possible to edit colors individually as you wish.)</p><p>For a more subtle color scheme, click on <code>Color</code>, select <code>Edit Colors...</code> and at the dialog box select the <code>Tableau 10 Light</code> qualitative color scheme, then click <code>Assign Palette</code> and <code>OK</code>:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_9a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>In the <code>Marks</code> shelf, change from <code>Automatic</code> to <code>Circle</code> to switch to solid circles.</p><p>As the circles overlap, let’s give them some transparency so each can be seen. Click on <code>Color</code> again, drop the transparency to 75% and give each circle a gray border to help distinguish them from one another. The chart should now look like this:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_10a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>It’s clear that there are a few outlier countries with very high GDP per capita, with most of the others clustered at the bottom of the range. Using a logarithmic scale for the X axis will help see differences in population density for most nations.</p><p>So right-click on the X axis and select <code>Edit Axis</code>. At the dialog box, check <code>Logarithmic</code>:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_11a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Running through the years, there are never any values of less that $100 on the X axis. So now let’s edit the axis range and also change the units so that it’s clear the figures are in $.</p><p>To fix the latter, hover over <code>GDP per capita</code> in the <code>Measures</code> panel and select <code>Default Properties&gt;Number Format...</code> and fill in the dialog box as follows:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_12.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Now right-click on the X axis and select <code>Edit Axis</code>. At the dialog box, check <code>Fixed</code> and set the <code>Start</code> value as <code>100</code>. Also edit the <code>Title</code>, to remove <code>Avg.</code> as only a single value is being shown:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_13a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Edit the Y axis <code>Title</code> to remove <code>Avg.</code> also. The chart should now look like this:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_14a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>There does indeed seem to be a relationship between wealth and life expectancy, so let’s draw a trend line. Switch to the <code>Analytics</code> tab in the panel at left, drag <code>Trend Line</code> over the chart area, and drop it onto the chart icon labeled <code>Logarithmic</code>:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_15a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Remember from the opening session that the relationship between ealth and life expectancy across nations is logarithmic, but the logarithmic X axis transforms the curve into a straight trend line. However, rather than a single trend line we have one for each region, and confidence bands around each line have also been drawn:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_16a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Now select <code>Analysis&gt;Trend Lines&gt;Edit Trend Lines</code> and edit the dialog box to the following:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_17a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Hover over the trend line to see its equation. (If you wish, you can also turn off the logarithmic option on the X axis temporarily, to see what the logaraithmic curve looks like.)</p><p>Right-click on the line, select <code>Format...</code> and change the thick black line to thinner gray dashes. The chart should now look like this:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_18a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Use the <code>Page</code> controls to play through the years again, and notice that the slope of the line becomes shallower over time.</p><p>Having explored this relationship, we could stop there. But we can also highlight larger countries by dragging <code>Population</code> to <code>Size</code>. After doing so, click on <code>Size</code> and move the slider to the right to increase the size of all of the circles.</p><p>Tableau’s default behavior is to scale circles correctly, by area. So the relative size of the circles corresponds to the countries’ population in each year.</p><p>The chart should now look something like this:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_19a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Now click on the title bars for the size and color legends and select <code>Hide Card</code> to remove them from the visualization. We can provide the values for the total amount of protected land through a tooltip, rather than a legend. And we will later make a map to serve as a color legend, making that redundant.</p><p>Hover over one of the circles, and notice the tooltip that appears. By default, all the fields we have used to make the visualization appear in the tooltip. (If you need any more, just drag those fields onto <code>Tooltip</code>.) Click on <code>Tooltip</code> and edit as follows:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_20a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Unchecking <code>Include command buttons</code> removes some additional Tableau tooltip functionality, giving a plain tooltip.</p><p>There’s a problem with the chart: Some of the smaller circles lie behind larger ones, which means that their tooltips can’t be accessed. To solve this, open the dropdown menu for <code>Country</code> in the <code>Marks</code> shelf, select <code>Sort</code> and fill in the dialog box as follows:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_20.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Now drag <code>Country</code> so it appears at the top of the list of fields in the <code>Marks</code> shelf. The sort we have just performed would not have been possible if we had unchecked <code>Aggregate Measures</code> earlier. It should ensure that the smallest circles always appear on top:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_21a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Take some time to consider how the chart is constructed in relation to the principles covered in this morning’s session, especially the perceptual heirarchy of visual cues.</p><h4 id="save-to-the-cloud"><a name="save-to-the-cloud" href="#save-to-the-cloud"></a>Save to the cloud</h4><p>Right-click on <code>Sheet 1</code> at bottom, select <code>Rename Sheet</code>, and call it <code>Bubble chart</code>.</p><p>Having finished this chart, now is a good time to save our work. From the top menu, select <code>File&gt;Save To Tableau Public</code>. At the logon dialog box enter your Tableau Public account details, give the Wookbook a suitable name and click <code>Save</code>. When the save is complete, you can close that window.</p><h4 id="make-a-map-to-use-as-a-color-legend"><a name="make-a-map-to-use-as-a-color-legend" href="#make-a-map-to-use-as-a-color-legend"></a>Make a map to use as a color legend</h4><p>Select <code>Worksheet&gt;New Worksheet</code> from the top menu, and double-click on <code>Country</code>. Tableau recognizes the names of countries and states/provinces; for the U.S., it also recognizes counties. Its default map-making behavior is to put a circle at the centroid of each area, which can be scaled and colored to reflect values from the data:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_22a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>However, we need each country to be filled with color by region. Using <code>Show Me</code>, switch to the <code>filled map</code> option, and each nation should fill with color. Drag <code>Region</code> to <code>Color</code> and see how the same color scheme we used previously carries over to the map. Click on <code>Color</code>, set the transparency to 75% to match the bubble chart and remove the borders. Also click on <code>Tooltip</code> and uncheck <code>Show tooltip</code> so that no tooltip appears on the legend.</p><p>We will use this map as a color legend, so its separate color legend is unnecessary. Click the color legend’s title bar and select <code>Hide Card</code> to remove it from the visualization.</p><p>Center the map in the view by clicking on it, holding and panning. It should now look something like this:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_23a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Rename the worksheet <code>Inset map</code> and save to the web again.</p><h4 id="make-a-dashboard-displaying-the-bubble-chart-and-map-color-legend"><a name="make-a-dashboard-displaying-the-bubble-chart-and-map-color-legend" href="#make-a-dashboard-displaying-the-bubble-chart-and-map-color-legend"></a>Make a dashboard displaying the bubble chart and map color legend</h4><p>From the top menu, select <code>Dashboard&gt;New Dashboard</code>. We can set the size of the dashboard to fit the web page in which it will be embedded, and this can be a <code>Range</code>, giving some basic responsive design. For simplicity, we will set the dashboard to <code>Laptop</code> size.</p><p>Drag <code>Bubble chart</code> from the panel at left to the main panel. The default title, from the worksheet name, isn’t very informative, so right-click on that and select <code>Hide Title</code>.</p><p>Right click on the <code>Year</code> title for the <code>Page</code> control, and <code>Edit title</code> to increase its font size.</p><p>Notice that Tableau allows you to drop various other items onto a dashboard: horizontal and vertical containers, text boxes, images, web pages and blank space.</p><p>Drag a <code>Text</code> box onto bottom of the chart, until the lower part of the bubble chart becomes gray, showing where the new element will appear. Then add the source information:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_24.jpg" alt=""></p><p>The source text box will be much too large, so extend the size of the chart window as appropriate. Now is also a good time to set the font size for the axis labels, which are a little small. Right-click on each axis, select <code>Format</code> and increase the font size to <code>10pt</code>.</p><p>Now select <code>Dashboard&gt;Show Title</code> from the top menu. Right-click on it, select <code>Edit Title...</code> and change the default <code>&lt;Sheet Name&gt;</code> to something more informative:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_25.jpg" alt=""></p><p>When adding items to a dashboard, you can make them <code>Tiled</code> or <code>Floating</code>, which allows them to be placed over the top of one another. Switch to <code>Floating</code> and drag the map onto the bottom right of the chart. Hide its title, and if necessary reduce its size so that it doesn’t obscure any of the circles in any of the years. Also right-click on the map and select <code>Hide View Toolbar</code> and <code>Hide Map Search</code>. This will remove the map’s interactive controls.</p><p>The finished dashboard should look something like this:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_26a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Rename the dashboard and save to the web.</p><p>Once the dashboard is online, use the <code>Share</code> link at the bottom to obtain an embed code, which can be inserted into the HTML of any web page.</p><p><img src="img/chcf_27.jpg" alt=""></p><p>(You can also <code>Download</code> a static view of the graphic as a PNG image or a PDF.)</p><h4 id="some-more-questions-to-ask-this-data"><a name="some-more-questions-to-ask-this-data" href="#some-more-questions-to-ask-this-data"></a>Some more questions to ask this data</h4><p>I next decided to explore the data on neonatal mortality, asking the following questions:</p><ul>
<li>How have the total number of neonatal deaths changed over time, globally, regionally and nationally?</li>
<li>How has the neonatal death rate for each country changed over time?</li>
</ul><h4 id="create-new-calculated-variables"><a name="create-new-calculated-variables" href="#create-new-calculated-variables"></a>Create new calculated variables</h4><p>The data contains fields on birth and neonatal death rates, but not the total numbers, which must be calculated. From the top menu, select <code>Analysis&gt;Create Calculated Field</code>. Fill in the dialog box as follows (just start typing a field name to select it for use in a formula):</p><p><img src="img/chcf_28a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Notice that calculated fields appear in the <code>Data</code> panel preceded by an <code>=</code> symbol.</p><p>Now create a second calculated field giving the total number of neonatal deaths:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_29a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>(We have run some simple arithmetic, but it’s possible to use a wide variety of functions to manipulate the data in various ways.)</p><h4 id="make-a-series-of-treemaps-showing-neonatal-deaths-over-time"><a name="make-a-series-of-treemaps-showing-neonatal-deaths-over-time" href="#make-a-series-of-treemaps-showing-neonatal-deaths-over-time"></a>Make a series of treemaps showing neonatal deaths over time</h4><p>For any one year, I realized that a treemap would allow me to directly compare the neonatal deaths in each country, nested by region.</p><p>In a new worksheet, drag <code>Country</code> and <code>Region</code> onto <code>Columns</code> and <code>Neonatal deaths</code> onto <code>Rows</code>. Then open <code>Show Me</code> and select the <code>treemap</code> option. The initial chart should look like this:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_30a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Now remove <code>Region</code> from <code>Label</code> to  show just the country names, and drag <code>Region</code> to <code>Color</code>. Click on <code>Color</code> and set transparency to 75%, to match the appearance of our previous chart.</p><p>The treemap should now look like this:</p><p><img src="img/chcf_31a.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Notice that Tableau has by default aggregated <code>Neonatal deaths</code> using the <code>SUM</code> function, so what we are seeing is the number for each country added up across the years.</p><p>To see one year at a time, we need to filter by year.

This doesn’t exist in any one field in the loaded data, because the same name can be used for storms in different years. However, if we combine year and name, that will be a unique identifier for each storm. (In fact, it will also split one storm, “Zeta,” which started in December 2005 and continued into January 2006, into two, but we will not worry about that.)</p><p>To create the necessary field, select <code>Analysis&gt;Create Calculated Field</code> from the top menu and create a new field called <code>Year - Name</code> using the following formula</p><pre><code data-origin="&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;STR([Year]) + &quot; - &quot; + [Name]

If Tableau does not recognize that you want a make a map, hover over and click on <code>symbol map</code> in the <code>Show Me</code> panel.</p><p>Why is there a single point, located in an expanse of nothingness (actually somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean)? By default, Tableau has aggregated all the longitudes and latitudes, calculating an average, or <code>AVG</code>. Turn off that aggregation by selecting <code>Analysis&gt;Aggregate Measures</code> from the top menu.</p><p>There should now be a large number of points, located on a recognizable map:</p><p><img src="img/tableau_4.jpg" alt=""></p><p>We want to draw lines for each storm, not points for each observation. So in the <code>Marks</code> shelf, switch from <code>Automatic</code> to <code>Line</code>. Notice that Tableau’s default behaviour is to draw a single line through all of the points, running from left to right:</p><p><img src="img/tableau_5.jpg" alt=""></p><p>The first step in fixing this is to tell Tableau to give the storms distinctive colors. So next drag the calculated field <code>Year - Name</code> onto <code>Color</code>. The storms now have different colors, and <code>Year - Name</code> now appears with a <code>Color</code> icon in the <code>Marks</code> shelf. But their tracks are still not drawn correctly:</p><p><img src="img/tableau_6.jpg" alt=""></p><p>To fix this, we need to specify that the lines should be drawn according to the timing of the observations, not from left to right.

The paths for each of the storms are now drawn correctly:</p><p><img src="img/tableau_8.jpg" alt=""></p><p>The general point to be drawn from this exercise so far is that, when working with Tableau (and indeed when visualizing data more generally), you need to think carefully about your data, and whether and how it is aggregated, to get the correct display for the story you want to tell.</p><h4 id="encode-maximum-wind-speed-by-the-thickness-of-the-lines"><a name="encode-maximum-wind-speed-by-the-thickness-of-the-lines" href="#encode-maximum-wind-speed-by-the-thickness-of-the-lines"></a>Encode maximum wind speed by the thickness of the lines</h4><p>The destructiveness of a storm depends in large part on the strength of its winds.

But before we filter the data by year, it is important to consider Tableau’s default behavior when data is filtered, which is to redraw maps and charts to reflect the values in the filtered data. In years with fewer, weaker storms over a smaller area, this means that the map will zoom in to those storms, and the scale used for the thickness of the lines will adjust to reflect the range of wind speeds in the filtered data. We don’t want this behaviour: Instead, we want the map and the scale used to encode wind speed to remain constant for each year.</p><p>Freeze the wind speed scale by clicking on the downward-pointing triangle that appears when you hover over the title bar for the legend at bottom left and select <code>Edit sizes</code>.
