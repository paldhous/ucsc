We will cover essential skills of investigative reporting, including obtaining documents through Public Records Act requests, using online reporting resources, computer-assisted reporting, and ethical and legal issues. After 10 weeks, students will complete an article of ~2000 words, concentrating on an issue of societal/political importance.</p><h3 id="schedule"><a name="schedule" href="#schedule"></a>Schedule</h3><ul>
