# Software and other tools

### [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)

Some of the tools we will use are Firefox add-ons. Ensure that you have the latest version of this popular web browser. [Download Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/), or if already installed, if necessary update to the latest version [following these instructions](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/update-firefox-latest-version).

### [Table2Clipboard](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dafizilla-table2clipboard/) and [DownThemAll!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/)
Two handy Firefox add-ons, which will help you extract data from the web. Install them in Firefox [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dafizilla-table2clipboard/) and [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/).

### [Import.io](https://import.io/)
A relatively new tool for scraping data from the web, without the need to write code. [Download here](https://import.io/download/osx). You will also need to sign up for an account at the `Sign in` link on the home page.

### [Kimono](https://www.kimonolabs.com/)
Another web scraping tool that works from your web browser. Sign up for a free account, then [install the Bookmarklet](https://www.kimonolabs.com/learn/getstarted). There is also an extension from Google Chrome.

### [Open Refine](http://openrefine.org/)
A powerful tool for data cleaning, once owned by Google, now open source. Download the latest **stable version** [from here](http://openrefine.org/download.html). When launched, Open Refine will work in your default web browser; note that your data remains on your computer, and is not uploaded to the web. If you have issues installing Open Refine on a Mac, you may need to reset your security settings to allow the installation of third-party applications, see [here](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/590). If you still have problems, try installing Java for OS X from [here](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US).

### [SQLite Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/)
We will manage SQLite databases using this Firefox add-on. Install in Firefox [from here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/). There is no need to separately install SQLite.

### [LibreOffice Calc](http://www.libreoffice.org/discover/calc/)

Open-source spreadsheet application, part of wider office productivity suite. [Download LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/).

### [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/)
Your go-to resource for color schemes to encode data. Web app: no installation required.

### [Tableau Public](http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/)
Visualization software designed for exploratory graphic analysis, which also allows you to create interactive online graphics without JavaScript coding. [Download here](http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/download). You will also need to [sign up](https://public.tableausoftware.com/auth/signup) for a free Tableau Public account.

The Public version of the software requires you to save your visualizations to the open web. However, members of Investigative Reporters and Editors can obtain a [license for the Professional version](http://), which allows you to save workbooks on your machine. In any case, I strongly recommend that students [join IRE](http://www.ire.org/membership/apply/) as a student member: it is a leader for training in data journalism.
