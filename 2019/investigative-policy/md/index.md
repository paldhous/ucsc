#UCSC SciCom: Policy and Investigative Reporting

This class focuses on in-depth and investigative reporting, where science and technology meets public policy and society. We will cover essential skills of investigative reporting, including obtaining documents through public records requests, using online reporting resources, and analyzing data and documents. We will also explore ethical and legal issues. Over 10 weeks, students will work in pairs to complete a substantial article on an issue of societal/political importance.
